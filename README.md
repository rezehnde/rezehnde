### Upcoming Side Projects
- **cPanel accounts usage monitor**: to help small hosting companies to see what is going on inside every cPanel account administrated by them. A friend of mine, who managed +70 cPanel accounts at Planet Hoster host provider wants a dashboard to see which resources are being used by his customers in order to be texted when someting unusual happens (for example: one of his customers is sending spam or the website is using a lot of memory).
- **Hausaufgaben Generator**: when studying the German language you need to train a lot to memorize the rules of declination and the rules of the German Cases (Akkusative und Dativ). So, I am wondering how to generate a list of ramdomic incomplete phrases in order to give them as exercises for students who wants to train their German Vocabulary and Grammar.  
- **Microlearning app**: an app to send an e-mail every day about something small that is good to learn. Imagine if everyday a bot wents to a website and get just one simple little thing and send this to you by e-mail.
- **Lunch picker**: an app where small restaurantes can delivery food without being charged 20% as iFood does in Brazil. But, a way more simpler than iFood. Less is more.
- **Bring your umbrella notifier**: simple mobile app that sends you a phone notification in the morning telling you if you should bring your umbrella to work.
